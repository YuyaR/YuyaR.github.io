This is a practice coding project inspired by a hackathon that required the participants to program a weather forecast system.

This code provides a GUI that allows users to input a location (i.e. address, city) and choose from "Today", "tomorrow", "hourly", and receive the general weather condition and temperature for the chosen time period.

## General mechanism
Locations are translated into coordinates with Google Geocoding API, and the weather is called with Openweathermap API.

GUI is built with PySimpleGUI.

## Dependencies
requests
PySimpleGUI
datetime

## Coding environment
Spyder 4.0.1 in Anaconda 1.9.12
